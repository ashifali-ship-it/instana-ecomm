|------------|---------------------------|
| web        | Frontend UI               |

## Prerequisites

- Azure account with AKS cluster provisioned
- `kubectl` installed and configured for your AKS cluster
- Helm 3 installed

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Deploy Helm Charts

Deploy each service to its own namespace:

```bash
# Example: deploy the web service
helm install web AKS/helm/web -n web --create-namespace

# Deploy other services
helm install catalogue AKS/helm/catalogue -n catalogue --create-namespace
helm install cart AKS/helm/cart -n cart --create-namespace
helm install payment AKS/helm/payment -n payment --create-namespace
helm install shipping AKS/helm/shipping -n shipping --create-namespace
helm install ratings AKS/helm/ratings -n ratings --create-namespace
helm install user AKS/helm/user -n user --create-namespace
```

## 2. Verify Deployment

Check that all pods and services are running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -A
kubectl get svc -A
```

## 3. Notes

- **Environment-specific values**: Modify `AKS/helm/<service>/values.yaml` for dev, staging, or production settings.  
- **Secrets**: Store secrets using Kubernetes Secrets or Azure Key Vault; do not include them in Helm values.  
- **Ingress / Load Balancer**: Configure in `values.yaml` if public access is required.
